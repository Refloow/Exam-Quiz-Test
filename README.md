## Usage Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Editing Questions & Timer**
Modify the provided HTML file to:
- Set the total **quiz time**.
- Input your **questions and answers**.

  ```
  /******************************************************
     * 1) CONFIGURATION & QUESTION DATA (inlined)
  ******************************************************/
    const config = {
      // total time in seconds
      totalTime: 90,
      // how many questions to pick
      questionsToPick: 5
    };
  ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Question Format (Human-Readable)**
This is how to prepare your questions before using the conversion tool to add them to the test

> Number in front indicates start of an question

> Answers need to be below the question

> Questions should not have empty lines below each other in prepared data 

> ‚Ä¢ for answers is optional, answers can be added without it by being below the question. Program will ignore ‚Ä¢ if its present it. Everything in the lines below the question is read as answer, this is useful if questions are copied from a PDF

> Everything selected with an * next to it is marked as a correct answer

> To make multichoice question just add * to more answers

> To make a multilined question use ```<q> </q>``` to wrap the question around

> For code containing multilined questions to display in a codeblock use 3 ` on the left and right side of the code

EXAMPLES OF PREPARED DATA FOR CONVERSION:

```txt
1. Choose the right answer to 2+2
‚Ä¢ 1
